# 🧩 Modurator

**Modurator** is a sleek, fast, and minimalist website built to help modders easily discover curated **modlists** for Bethesda games — like *Skyrim*, *Fallout*, *Oblivion*, and more.

Instead of digging through forums, Nexus comments, or scattered Reddit posts, Modurator serves as a clean, community-centered hub to browse handpicked, high-quality modlists — all linking back to the original creators.

## 🎯 Purpose

Modurator solves a simple but frustrating problem: finding **reliable modlists** without wading through chaos.

- 📚 No individual mods, just full curated **modlists**
- 🔗 Every list links back to the creator’s original site (Nexus, GitHub, Reddit, etc.)

## 🧠 Features (WIP)

- 🎮 Game-specific areas with unique background + color theme
- 🧩 Curated modlist cards with tags, previews, and details
- 🔎 Filterable search system (e.g., Vanilla+, Overhaul, Survival, Visual)
- 🧰 Learning section with guides and tools for new modders
- 🚫 No user login, no comments, no tracking bloat
